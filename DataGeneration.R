  #         a preference for treatment A, B, or having no preference in stage 1 and treatment C, D, or having no
  #         no preference in stage 2. Note, pref_probx is a Nx3 matrix with the

  ### Preference Model: Stage 1 Propensity Scores for Preference ###
  #    Here we generate preference for first stage treatment for each patient. The true propensity for exhibiting a 
  #    preference for treatment A, B, or having no preference for each subject in the simulation population 
  #    is modeled using a logit model approach where first-stage propensity scores for preference are conditional on the 
  #    first-stage baseline covariates X1 and X2. In our preference model, 
  #    we search for an intercept via the uniroot function in r which allows us to control the proportion of subjects exhibiting 
  #    no preference/preference for A/B

  ## generate preference of first stage treatment of each individual ##
  
  # put probabilities into a matrix
  pref_prob1 <- cbind(prob_A,prob_B,prob_NP) 
  colnames(pref_prob1) <- c("Prob Prefer A", "Prob Prefer B", "Prob No Preference") # each row is a subject's probability to prefer A, prefer B, or have no preference

  ### CHECKS ###
  # sum(prop.table(table(S1_Preference))) # check to make sure prob_A, prob_B, prob_NP sum to 1
  # prop.table(table(S1_Preference)) # check if observed proportions close to targets
  # length(which(S1_Preference == "A")) / length(which(S1_Preference == "A" | S1_Preference == "B")) # should be close to pTheta_A
  
  
  ### Stage 1 treatment assigned ###
  #    For each subject in the simulated population we generate their stage 1 assigned treatment
  #    based on the true propensities for exhibiting a preference for treatment A, B, or having no preference
  #    Prefer A: get A
  #    Prefer B: get B

  ### Generate Preference Indicator ###
  #    Here we create an indicator, P1, for whether an individual had a preference in stage 1 or not. Specifically, 1

  P1 <- ifelse(S1_Preference == "A" | S1_Preference == "B", 1, 0)
  
  ### Generate Stage 1 Response variable ###
  #    For each subject we generate a binary response where 1 indicates the subjects responds
  #    to the assigned Stage 1 treatment and 0 indicates the subject does not response to the assigned 
  #    stage 1 treatment.

  R[P1 == 0 & T1==0] <- rbinom(sum(P1 == 0 & T1==0),1, pi_B) # got randomized treatment B in Stage 1
  
  ### Prefernce Model: Stage 2 Propensity Scores for Preference ###
  #    Here we generate preference of second stage treatment only for first-stage non-responders. Patients who respond
  #    continue on the stage 1 treatment. The true propensity for exhibiting a 
  #    preference for treatment C, D, or having no preference for non-responders in the simulation population 
  #    is modeled using a logit model approach where second-stage propensity scores for preference are conditional on whether
  #    the patient had a preference in stage 1. In our preference model, 
  #    we search for an intercept via the uniroot function in r which allows us to control the proportion of non-responder subjects 
  #    exhibiting no preference/preference for C/D
  
  # find non-responders
