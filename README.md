# PRPP-SMART
Companion code for "A Partially Randomized Patient Preference, Sequential, Multiple-Assignment, Randomized Trial Design Analyzed via Weighted and Replicated Frequentist and Bayesian Methods‚Äù.

## Usage Note
The code in this repository is in active development. To view or use stable code, see the appropriate releases:
- [v1.0.0](../../releases/tag/v1.0.0): Release accompanying publication to _Statistics in Medicine_.

## File Descriptions
- [DataGeneration.R](DataGeneration.R): Main function used to generate data from a two-stage PRPP-SMART with binary end-of-stage outcome.
- [Frequentist_WRRM.R](Frequentist_WRRM.R): Simulation code for frequentist weighted and replicated regression models (WRRMs) to estimate embedded dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) in PPRPP-SMART under all scenarios considered in the manuscript. 
- [Bayesian_WRRM.R](Bayesian_WRRM.R): Simulation code for Bayesian weighted and replicated regression models (WRRMs) to estimate embedded dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) in PRPP-SMART under all scenarios considered in the manuscript. Note, Bayesian simulations are reccomened to be run on a high-performance cluster rather than a laptop.
- [nsim_toget_500.R](nsim_toget_500.R): Functions used to determine the number of simulations needed to run per scenario in order to achieve 500 total simulations. 
- [Result_Figures.R](Result_Figures.R): Code for creating figures in manuscript. 

## Folder Descriptions
- The [WilliamsSavitsky2021_Functions](WilliamsSavitsky2021_Functions) folder contains the functions to implement the method outlined in Williams, M. R., and Savitsky, T. D. (2021) Uncertainty Estimation for Pseudo-Bayesian Inference Under Complex Sampling, https://doi.org/10.1111/insr.12376. Note, these functions are also available in the r package [csSampling](https://github.com/RyanHornby/csSampling). 

- The [Stan](Stan) folder contains the stan models used to perform the full and traditional Bayesian weighted and replicated regression models (WRRMs) outlined in the manuscript as well as a [pseudo stan script](Stan/PRPP_SMART_Pseudo_StanCode.stan) to help users implement the Bayesian WRRM.
